# Dot Files

Welcome! Here is my (very) unpolished .dotfile configuration. Below are some setup notes to my future self, after I completely forgot what I setup or how I did it.

## Setup

### Dotfile setup 

Follow instructions here for configuring git repo at your base path: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

Or see local copy here, if that link no longer works: [DOTFILES](./DOTFILES.md).

### Shell setup

- Install Alacritty (cross platform terminal emulator): https://alacritty.org/

- Install zsh (shell): https://ohmyz.sh/

- Install tmux (terminal multiplexer): https://github.com/tmux/tmux

- Install fzf (command-line fuzzy finder, used by neovim): https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

- Install ripgrep (faster grep alternative written in Rust, used by neovim): https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep

- Install zoxide for `z` in place of `cd`: https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide

### Env setup

#### JS
