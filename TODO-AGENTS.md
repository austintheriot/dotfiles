Take the first item from this list. Mark it as claimed in one commit, do the work, then remove it when done in another commit. This prevents any agent race conditions. If TODOS is empty, leave the heading in place l move onto QUESTIONS. For any of these, if the fix is clear/mechanistic, perform it autonomously as a single commit using /test-driven-development. If not, surface for discussion via the /brainstorming skill before acting.

# TODOS:

- Our testing & repo infrastructure has grown quite complex. Let's consider porting some of these to Rust scripts -- both for ease of reading/writing/updating/managing/testing, but also for speed. Brainstorm options here
- Fix CI warning: "Compare shared paths
Node.js 20 is deprecated. The following actions target Node.js 20 but are being forced to run on Node.js 24: actions/checkout@v4. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-19-deprecation-of-node-20-on-github-actions-runners/"
- Fix CI warning: "macOS / macos-latest
The following taps are not trusted:
  aws/tap

Homebrew is currently ignoring formulae, casks and commands from these taps because tap trust is required.

Untap them with:
  brew untap aws/tap
Trust specific formulae, casks and commands with:
  brew trust --formula <user>/<tap>/<formula>
  brew trust --cask <user>/<tap>/<cask>
  brew trust --command <user>/<tap>/<command>
Whole-tap trust is broader and includes all current and future formulae,
casks and commands from the listed taps. Trust whole taps with:
  brew trust aws/tap
To disable trust checks:
  export HOMEBREW_NO_REQUIRE_TAP_TRUST=1
This is not recommended and will be removed in a later release.
For more information, see:

# QUESTIONS (leave until queried)

- Are our git hooks currently configured to run the leak check on commit and then the test suite on push? If not, they should.
- Are we using the Docker container for the pre-push test suite? Should we be?

# DEFERRED TODOS

- macOS Docker images (e.g. https://github.com/dockur/macos): investigated,
  not viable. Recorded so it is not re-researched.
  `dockur/macos` is not a macOS container; it is QEMU/KVM booting a macOS VM
  inside a container (base image `qemux/qemu`, OpenCore + OVMF). Three
  independent blockers, each disqualifying on its own:
  (1) It cannot run on a Mac. Its README: "Docker Desktop on Linux, macOS,
  and Windows 10 does not currently provide KVM access to containers and is
  therefore not supported." It needs `/dev/kvm` on a Linux or Windows 11
  host, so it is useless for the local pre-push gate.
  (2) Setup is a manual twelve-step click-through of Disk Utility and Setup
  Assistant in a browser VNC viewer. Nothing scriptable for a hook or CI.
  (3) The guest is x86_64 only (AVX2 requirement, amd64-pinned, no ARM64
  option), so it would test Intel macOS. `.claude/hooks/notify.sh` hardcodes
  `/opt/homebrew/bin/aerospace` and `.zshrc-mac` uses `$(brew --prefix)`,
  both Apple Silicon paths -- it would exercise the wrong architecture.
  Plus a licensing bind: Apple's EULA restricts macOS virtualization to
  Apple hardware, while the technical requirements exclude macOS hosts. The
  only compliant setup is Linux on Apple-branded hardware. `sickcodes/Docker-OSX`
  is more scriptable but carries the same host and EULA constraints.
  Already solved a better way: `.github/workflows/test-suite.yml` runs the
  full suite on `macos-latest`, a real macOS VM on Apple hardware, licensed,
  with Homebrew preinstalled. All 16 suites pass there, and no tmux suite
  flakes, because a fresh runner never loads `.config/tmux/tmux-common.conf`.
- Isolate the test suite onto its own tmux server. `tests/lib.sh` calls bare
  `tmux`, so every tmux suite runs on the live server -- currently 23 windows,
  an attached client, and 6 global `after-*` hooks that fire
  `.scripts/tmux-update-window-names.sh` via `run-shell -b` (asynchronous).
  Those background invocations race the tests' own synchronous runs against
  the tests' own windows. `tmux-update-window-names.test.sh` fails about 25%
  of the time on the host (measured 5/20 runs) and 0/12 in the container,
  which is a pristine server with no client, no windows, and no hooks. Three
  different assertions rotate through the failure, which is why it reads as
  random: `switching active pane updates the name`, `empty name restores the
  labelled name`, `owned window follows branch changes`.
  Proposed fix: point `TMUX_TMPDIR` at the per-run fixture directory and use a
  dedicated socket (`tmux -L dotfiles-test-$$`) in `lib.sh`, giving the host
  the isolation the container already has. Deferred because it touches
  `lib.sh`, which every tmux suite depends on, so it wants a deliberate pass
  rather than a drive-by. Not urgent: the pre-push gate runs in the container,
  so this flake cannot block a push.
  Two failed fix attempts, recorded so they are not repeated:
  (1) retrying the state read (2 attempts, then 5 with a 20ms backoff) did not
  help -- 4/20 then 6/20;
  (2) an earlier "global hooks are not the cause" measurement was invalid,
  because it cleared the hooks but left the attached client and the live
  windows in place.

- Fix the silent stale name when `tmux display-message` returns empty.
  Separate latent bug in `.scripts/tmux-update-window-names.sh`, found
  while investigating the flake above and NOT its cause. `tmux display-message
  -p -F '#{pane_current_path}'` intermittently prints nothing while exiting 0
  with an empty stderr, measured at 1 to 6 calls in 3000 depending on server
  load. `#{window_name}` alone measured 0/3000, so it is specific to reading
  the pane path. The script treats that empty read as "this window has no
  directory" and returns without renaming, so the window silently keeps a
  stale name until the next hook fires. Needs a test that stubs tmux rather
  than racing the real server, and the stub must never target a real window id
  (an earlier attempt passed `-w '@1'`, which is a live window on this
  machine).
